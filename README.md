# demos
This repository will store files that I have created for use with endpoint protection demonstrations.  This repo is for private use only.
The files will often be picked up by malware scanners as the function of these files could be malicious when used inappropritely.

I will use these files to demonstrate for customers the AV ability to detect and or prevent these files from executing.
